# 03 Letters Of Intent

**Purpose:** Record LOIs or expressions of interest with clear distinctions between signed intent and ongoing discussions.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- LOI (Jan 2026): A regional health system submitted a non-binding letter outlining interest in piloting MeducateX for their surgical education council. The LOI emphasizes governance reviews and resource commitments before any deployment.  
- Interest note (Dec 2025): A safety-focused foundation discussed serving as an introduction partner; no LOI or signed agreement followed.

All entries note the status—signed LOI versus exploratory interest—so investors see how traction progresses without confusing interest with commitment.
