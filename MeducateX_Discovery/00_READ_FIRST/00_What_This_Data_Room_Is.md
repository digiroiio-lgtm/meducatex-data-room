# 00 What This Data Room Is

**Purpose:** Orient NDA-screened stakeholders to the Discovery-level materials housed under MeducateX_Discovery and signal the evaluation-only nature of every section.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

This folder delivers a single Discovery data room framed for seed to pre-Series A investors, institutional reviewers, and strategic partners. Access is gated behind an executed NDA, and every artifact is organized to support careful diligence without straying into clinical or legal guidance. Use this section as the opening note before moving into pitch, problem, and technical narratives.
