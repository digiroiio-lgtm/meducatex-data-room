**Purpose:** Clarify what the Discovery data room covers, its limits, and the kinds of judgements it supports.

- This repository focuses on institutional, surgical-education, and risk-awareness signals that are documented, auditable, and defensible.  
- The materials do not capture every operational detail; they center on the evidence we can share in strict compliance with HIPAA, privacy expectations, and governance boundaries.  
- Evaluations should remain at the Discovery stage; nothing in these documents obligates MeducateX to commercialize or deploy a solution without further governance approval.  
- The reader should use these assets to assess readiness, credibility, and partnership fit, not as a definitive clinical guidance or legal opinion.
