# 02 Disclaimers

**Purpose:** Establish the non-clinical, non-legal, and evaluation-only rules that govern use of the Discovery room.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- All content is provided for due diligence and evaluation purposes only; it is not medical advice, a diagnosis, or treatment guidance.  
- Nothing in this room constitutes legal advice or a contractual commitment beyond the NDA and any follow-up agreements explicitly negotiated with MeducateX.  
- Statements are kept conservative, factual, and timestamped; forward-looking commentary is marked with qualifiers and does not guarantee outcomes.  
- If additional documents are requested (e.g., contracts, pilot data), they will only be shared via the gated platform once the appropriate confidentiality controls are in place.
