# MeducateX Discovery Data Room

**Purpose:** Document the locked folder structure and navigation for the NDA-gated discovery materials.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

This single source of truth is intended for seed to pre-Series A investors, institutional reviewers, and strategic partners operating under an executed NDA. Each numbered folder is ordered to match the mandated review flow, and every document is written to survive VC, hospital, and legal scrutiny without offering clinical or legal advice. Academy-level pitch decks, PDFs, and attachments are referenced here but hosted on the gated platform layer (e.g., Papermark) when sensitive.
