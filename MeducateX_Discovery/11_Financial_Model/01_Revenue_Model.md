# 01 Revenue Model

**Purpose:** Describe the revenue model in narrative form without dumping spreadsheets.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Revenue comes from annual subscriptions tied to institutional seats, add-ons for governance reporting, and professional services for onboarding. The model stresses conservative assumptions (e.g., one new pilot per quarter). Each assumption is documented so reviewers understand the levers rather than relying on raw spreadsheets.
