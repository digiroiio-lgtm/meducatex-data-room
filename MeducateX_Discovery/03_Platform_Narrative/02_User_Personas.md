- **Education Directors:** Need a reliable repository of cases, competency checklists, and feedback to support annual training cycles.  
- **Quality & Safety Leads:** Seek continuous visibility into procedural risks and completion of mitigation activities.  
- **Surgical Coaches & Clinicians:** Require unobtrusive access to replayable content and peer learning resources while maintaining control over clinical decisions.  

Each persona uses MeducateX to document what they already do, formalize oversight, and create consistent feedback loops without mandating clinical pathways.
