# 01 Platform Positioning

**Purpose:** Define what MeducateX is and who it serves without overselling capabilities.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

MeducateX is a governance-aware surgical education and risk-awareness platform that catalogs, surfaces, and governs learning content and insights. It connects classroom-style content, OR documentation, and oversight reporting so that education leaders and quality teams can establish repeatable programs. The platform is not positioned as a diagnostic tool, nor does it replace clinical judgement.
