# 02 Sales Motion

**Purpose:** Outline the tangible steps for sales conversations, anchored in observed behavior.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Sales conversations follow a diagnostic call, alignment on governance needs, and a scoped pilot agreement. Decision-makers include quality, education, and risk teams, and the team tracks each opportunity against a minimal set of assumptions (e.g., governance readiness, budget windows). This is a fact-based motion; there are no projections about guaranteed closing timelines.
