# 00 Pitch Deck Reference

**Purpose:** Point the reviewer to the PDF pitch deck that opens the storytelling arc, anchoring the evaluation narrative without repeating the deck verbatim.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

The pitch deck is distributed via the gated platform (Papermark) as a PDF attachment. It follows the same logic as the documents housed here—conservative, investor-facing, and NDA-protected. Refer to that PDF for the visual storyline; these Markdown notes stay focused on the textual memos that clarify vision and strategic framing.
