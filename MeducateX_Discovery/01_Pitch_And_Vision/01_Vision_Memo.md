# 01 Vision Memo

**Purpose:** Communicate the long-term North Star for MeducateX within the surgical education and risk-awareness category.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

MeducateX is positioned as an institutional-grade surgical education and risk-awareness platform, not a consumer training app. The team is building tools that help hospitals institutionalize learning, surface safety signals, and reinforce governance over high-risk procedures. The vision bridges training, analytics, and oversight so that education leaders, quality teams, and risk committees can align on shared data.

This memo is intentionally restrained: it defines the category, describes where MeducateX fits, and avoids speculative hype. It names the success metrics (adoption, retention, oversight impact) that matter to the institutions we pursue.
