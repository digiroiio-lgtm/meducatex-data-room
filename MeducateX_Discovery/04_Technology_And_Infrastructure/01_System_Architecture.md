The architecture layers content management, playback, analytics, and governance modules. Content is ingested via secure upload or integrations, tagged, and stored in encrypted repositories. Playback surfaces are served to authenticated users through role-based access, while analytics feeds into dashboards for safety and training metrics. Every data path is documented so that institutions understand where sensitive data resides and how it is protected.
