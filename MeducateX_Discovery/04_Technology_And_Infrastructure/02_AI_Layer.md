**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

The AI layer assists with categorizing content, anonymizing PII, and recommending relevant learning paths based on usage patterns. Models operate on metadata (timestamps, tags) and do not expose underlying training datasets or raw clinical records. No weights, data dumps, or raw clinical inputs are shared in this room. The layer is purpose-built to enhance search, not to make clinical judgments.
