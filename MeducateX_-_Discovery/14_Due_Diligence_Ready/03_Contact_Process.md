# 03 Contact & Process Notes

**Purpose:** Provide the path for requests, questions, or deeper diligence engagements.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- Initial questions route through partnerships@meducatex.com (placeholder) and are triaged against the NDA list.  
- Requests for deeper diligence trigger a joint planning call with the founders to align scope and timing.  
- Any follow-up materials are delivered via the gated platform and remain under the original NDA.

This process reinforces the discipline behind the Discovery data room.
