# 01 Scope Of Disclosure

**Purpose:** Describe what is included in the Discovery room, what is intentionally excluded, and the boundaries of the shared content.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

The shared materials focus on institutional readiness, governance, surgical education, and risk-awareness insights that MeducateX can defensibly provide at the Discovery stage. Proprietary clinical decision-making, raw patient data, and legal contract drafts remain outside this scope to prevent premature or inappropriate usage. Evaluation is explicitly limited to what can be understood from the documents in this room and any additional materials the team shares under further gating.
