# 00 Overview And Navigation

**Purpose:** Orient NDA-confirmed reviewers to the Discovery room structure and explain how the folders should be approached.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

This room is organized to mirror the mandated review flow, beginning with orientation, moving through pitch and vision, and ending with governance, funding, and due diligence readiness. No material in this workspace is distributed outside the NDA, and every folder is ordered to minimize risk while maximizing clarity for institutional partners.
