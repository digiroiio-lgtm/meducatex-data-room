# 02 Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

**Purpose:** Outline the institution-level buyers and gatekeepers within a grounded, factual context.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Primary ICPs include:
- **Chief Medical Officers / Quality Leads:** Responsible for reducing variation and ensuring oversight of surgical education and risk signals.  
- **Surgical Education Directors:** Need structured content and reporting for trainee credentialing.  
- **Risk & Compliance Officers:** Want auditable proof that learning and awareness programs are governed properly.

Each ICP is evaluated on readiness (governance maturity, data privacy posture, capacity to pilot) rather than hype-driven demand.
