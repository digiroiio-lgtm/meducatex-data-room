The market consists of teaching hospitals, academic medical centers, and health systems prioritizing surgical safety and education. We segment by geography (U.S. and regulated international systems), service line (high-acuity surgery), and governance maturity. This framing keeps the TAM grounded in institutions with existing compliance programs and avoids inflated projections.
