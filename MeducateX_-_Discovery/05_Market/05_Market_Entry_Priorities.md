# 05 Market Entry Priorities

**Purpose:** Explain the order of focus without overstating certainty.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Priorities begin with institutional education pilots in early markets, scale through direct and partnership-led playbooks, and layer in sponsorship/insurer arrangements. The pitch deck’s GTM flywheel shows entry via pilot hospitals, followed by institutional rollout and payer adoption, pricing at $41K-$416K per hospital per month, and expansion into networks, national programs, and payer-backed deployments. Each step is documented with dependencies on governance approvals and partner readiness.
