# 03 Customer Segmentation

**Purpose:** Segment customers so investors understand prioritized institutional profiles.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Segments include:  
- **Physician networks (surgeons, residents, coaches):** Primary users who demand mobile, cross-device, and VR-ready access (MeducateX Lite) to multi-angle OR content and critical-moment quizzes.  
- **Institutions (CMOs, medical education directors, quality/risk teams):** Buyers requiring governance-ready reporting, structured curricula, and insurance-grade visibility before scaling pilots.  
- **Partners (insurers, sponsors, academic societies):** Organizations that co-fund pilots, align on risk awareness, and present the platform as an education-linked risk infrastructure.

This segmentation references behavior signals observed in the pitch deck-defined go-to-market flywheel: entry through education-led pilots, then expansion via governance and insurer introductions.
