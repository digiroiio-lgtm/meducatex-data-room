**Purpose:** Define the specific institutional audience for MeducateX.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Target market includes teaching hospitals, academic medical centers, and safety-oriented health systems with governance structures ready for surgical education and risk-awareness programs. We prioritize early-market institutions in OB-GYN, general surgery, and orthopedics that have surgical education councils, compliance teams, and the appetite to pilot multi-angle capture. The tertiary market expands once the core U.S. compliance and governance playbook proves repeatable.
