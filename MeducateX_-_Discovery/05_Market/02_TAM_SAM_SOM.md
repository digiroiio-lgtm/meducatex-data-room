TAM is limited to U.S. and regulated international systems with surgical education and governance programs (approx. 1500 institutions). SAM further narrows to systems evaluating risk-aware education pilots today (roughly 200 prospective partners). SOM represents the first cohorts we can meaningfully support within 18 months, based on current team capacity.
