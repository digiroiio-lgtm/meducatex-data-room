# RISQON Scoring Logic

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level view of the RISQON scoring logic used for risk-awareness signals.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

RISQON aggregates metadata (procedure type, participant roles, engagement patterns) and compliance tags to surface risk awareness signals. It tracks learning interactions, calculates aggregate severity indicators, and feeds the results into governance dashboards without identifying individuals. The scoring logic avoids doctor ranking, remains anonymous, and is legally safe while making risk visible earlier than traditional analytics.
