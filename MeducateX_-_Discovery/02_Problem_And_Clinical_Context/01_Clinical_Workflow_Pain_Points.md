# 01 Clinical Workflow Pain Points

**Purpose:** Document the operational gaps and pain points in surgical workflows that justify MeducateX without offering clinical direction.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Key friction points include inconsistent training for surgical teams, ad-hoc feedback loops, and limited visibility into how learning transfers to practice. These areas lead to variation in safety practices, replayable learning opportunities, and institutional memory. MeducateX is scoped to bring structure, not to prescribe clinical judgement.
