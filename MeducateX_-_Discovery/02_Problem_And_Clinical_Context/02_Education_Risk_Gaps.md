# 02 Education & Risk-Awareness Gaps

**Purpose:** Highlight the gaps in education and risk awareness that MeducateX intends to address, within an evaluation-only tone.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Clinicians and learners often lack consistent, institutionally curated content that links procedural practice with risk outcomes. Feedback loops are fragmented, and many programs rely on occasional morbidity and mortality reviews that do not scale. MeducateX surfaces ongoing signals (e.g., case reviews, peer insights) in a way that respects clinician autonomy while elevating awareness of structural risk factors.
