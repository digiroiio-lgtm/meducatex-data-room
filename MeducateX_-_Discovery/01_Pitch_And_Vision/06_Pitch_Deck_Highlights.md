- **Problem:** Surgical expertise remains unwritten and localized; critical moments stay invisible and training is not standardized.  
- **Solution:** Capture real multi-angle surgery, standardize the curriculum/quiz/certification loop, and annotate critical moments through AI-powered risk infrastructure.  
- **Platform:** MeducateX Studio records, annotates, and distributes content through web, mobile (MeducateX Lite), VR, and the MeduShip field-execution platform so institutions can operationalize learning across contexts.  
- **Moat:** MeducateX Surgical Cues™ module serves as the risk-intelligence layer, surfacing aggregate-only behavior signals, scoring recordability, and highlighting the best angles while honoring legal, compliance, and institutional guardrails.  
- **Market:** $100B+ global opportunity; SAM $28B+ high-risk surgical specialties; SOM $1–2B reachable through insurer-backed pilots.  
- **Business model:** Hybrid B2C/B2B-B2E with sponsorship and insurer revenue, pricing focused on institutional licenses plus governance modules, and premium services that support rollouts.  
- **Traction & team:** 24 structured courses, 12 expert surgeons, global presentations, and a team combining surgical insiders with technologists who own capture, governance, and delivery.  
- **Roadmap:** Foundation and U.S. scale now, followed by infrastructure/endgame (global expansion, insurer alignments) once governance and compliance milestones clear.
