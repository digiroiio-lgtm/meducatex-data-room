# 05 Ask Fund

**Purpose:** Present the current seed-stage ask, structure, valuation anchors, and milestone expectations within a VC-grade, risk-conscious tone.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- **Target raise:** $6.0M SAFE (post-money).  
- **Structure:** $3.0M + $3.0M (milestone-based).  
- **Valuation:** Pre-money $34.0M, post-money (fully funded) $40.0M; informed by market comparables and independent external advisory benchmarks.  

**Milestones (18-month horizon, tranche 2 trigger):**  
1. Execute three hospital contracts.  
2. Close five paid pilots totaling >= $250k ARR (annualized).  
3. Onboard 1,000 surgeons with 80% annual retention.  
4. Platform v1.0 live with compliance completed.

**SAFE terms:** Post-money, single valuation cap, no embedded discount; any additional terms are spelled out in the standard agreement to keep diligence efficient.

**Team confidence & risk management:** The founding and delivery team combines surgical education, governance, and technical delivery expertise, which lets us move deliberately, anticipate institutional compliance needs, and maintain tight control over risk. We present this ask with that same discipline—no hype, just measurable progress and transparency about how risk is being managed.
