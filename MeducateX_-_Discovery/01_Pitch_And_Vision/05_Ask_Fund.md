# 05 Ask Fund

**Purpose:** Present the current seed-stage ask, structure, valuation anchors, and milestone expectations within a VC-grade, risk-conscious tone.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- **Target raise:** $6.0M SAFE (post-money).  
- **Structure:** Two tranches ($3.0M + $3.0M), with the second tranche tied to milestone validation so capital is deployed as pilots and governance progress are demonstrably underway.  
- **Valuation:** Pre-money $34.0M, post-money (fully funded) $40.0M; this range reflects market comparables and independent advisory benchmarks, not promotional narrative.  

**Milestones (tranche 2 trigger, 18-month horizon):**  
1. Secure contracts with three hospitals that are approved for pilots.  
2. Progress five paid pilots generating at least $250k ARR in aggregate.  
3. Onboard 1,000 surgeons with >80% annual retention, ensuring the platform proves adoption without overstating adoption promises.  
4. Deliver Platform v1.0 with compliance completed and documented governance controls.

**SAFE terms:** Post-money, single valuation cap, no embedded discount; any additional terms are spelled out in the standard agreement to keep diligence efficient.

**Team confidence & risk management:** The founding and delivery team combines surgical education, governance, and technical delivery expertise, which lets us move deliberately, anticipate institutional compliance needs, and maintain tight control over risk. We present this ask with that same discipline—no hype, just measurable progress and transparency about how risk is being managed.
