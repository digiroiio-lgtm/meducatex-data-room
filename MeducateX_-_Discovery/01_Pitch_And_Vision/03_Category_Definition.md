# 03 Category Definition

**Purpose:** Define the category in a clear, non-promotional tone so investors understand where MeducateX fits.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

MeducateX belongs to the surgical education and governance-awareness category, differentiating itself from LMS vendors by emphasizing safety signals, audit trails, and sponsorship-fueled distribution. We define our TAM at $100B+, SAM at $28B+ (high-risk specialties such as OB-GYN, general surgery, orthopedics), and SOM at $1-2B reachable via insurer-backed institutional deployments in early markets. The category remains distinct from diagnostic AI, focusing instead on education, risk visibility, and compliance infrastructure that hospitals accept.
