**Purpose:** Define the phases for product maturity while noting dependencies and lack of guarantees.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

- **Phase 1 (Discovery):** Secure pilots, build governance scaffolding, and document early outcomes.  
- **Phase 2 (Structured Adoption):** Extend to additional departments once pilot reviews and compliance sign-offs are complete.  
- **Phase 3 (Scaling Governance):** Invest in analytics and automation, subject to continued funding and institutional approvals.

Dependencies include clinical council review, legal compliance checks, and partner readiness. No phase is a promise; all are subject to institutional timing.
