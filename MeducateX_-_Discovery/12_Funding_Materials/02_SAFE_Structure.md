# 02 SAFE Structure

**Purpose:** Explain the SAFE terms without emotional language or implied discounts.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

The current raise uses a SAFE instrument with a defined valuation cap and optional pro-rata rights. Any discounts or conversion mechanics are clearly spelled out so legal teams can review them. There is no implied discount beyond what the SAFE defines.
