# 03 Advisors

**Purpose:** Describe MeducateX’s advisory ecosystem across clinical, governance, commercial, market intelligence, and valuation domains, including scope, engagement structure, and safeguards that ensure advisory input supports diligence without implying endorsement or fiduciary authority.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

## Advisory Model (Summary)
MeducateX maintains a multi-domain, non-fiduciary advisory model for Seed-stage institutional readiness. Advisors validate assumptions, stress-test positioning, and inform execution while founders retain decision authority.

All advisors:
- are non-executive and non-fiduciary
- provide non-binding input
- are engaged via paid, milestone-based, or time-bound arrangements
- hold no board seats or voting rights
- are disclosed in role-based / masked terms at the Discovery stage

Identities and detailed terms may be shared selectively during deep diligence, subject to NDA scope.

- signals institutional maturity at Seed,  
- avoids dependence on any single advisor viewpoint,
