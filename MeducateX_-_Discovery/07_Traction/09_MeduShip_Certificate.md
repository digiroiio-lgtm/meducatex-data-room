MeduShip issued a MeduMaster Certificate of Participation covering advanced masterclasses (“Three-Piece Penile Prosthesis” and “Hardrock Sandwich Technique”) upon Dr. Aliyev’s completion of the online modules and on-site Istanbul clinical sequence (20–23 January 2026). The certificate is signed by the MeducateX instructor and Head of MeducateX, reinforcing the supervised, non-diagnostic nature of the program.

**Reference note:** The certificate is the first credential of the MeduShip pathway and documents the sequence from online education to in-person observation and fellowship-level validation.
