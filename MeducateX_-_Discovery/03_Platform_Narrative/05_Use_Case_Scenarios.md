# 05 Use Case Scenarios

**Purpose:** Illustrate typical institutional scenarios in a descriptive tone.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

Scenario A: An education council uses the capture → curriculum → quiz → certification flow to document competency across cases; RISQON highlights critical moments and sends aggregate safety signals to compliance.  
Scenario B: A quality team monitors surgeon engagement via MeducateX Lite and VR sessions while referencing risk insights to prioritize coaching.  
Scenario C: MeduShip operationalizes online learning into supervised field execution, shortening time-to-competency across hospitals.

Each scenario remains descriptive and refrains from promising specific outcomes.
