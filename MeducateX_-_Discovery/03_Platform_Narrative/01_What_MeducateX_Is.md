MeducateX is a surgical education and risk-awareness platform that captures multi-angle surgical footage, structures it via the Studio capture and MeduShip field execution flows, and delivers it through responsive experiences (web, mobile MeducateX Lite, VR) for surgeons, residents, admins, and compliance teams. It surfaces education-linked risk signals, governance reporting, and audit trails without making clinical or legal claims.
