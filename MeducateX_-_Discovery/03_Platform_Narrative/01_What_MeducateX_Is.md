**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

MeducateX is a surgical education and risk-awareness platform that captures authorized multi-angle surgical footage, structures it via the Studio capture and MeduShip field execution flows, and delivers it through responsive experiences (web, mobile MeducateX Lite, and VR) for surgeons, residents, administrators, and compliance teams.\n\nThe platform surfaces education-linked risk-awareness signals, governance reporting, and audit trails to support review, training, and institutional oversight, without providing medical advice, clinical decision support, or legal determinations.
