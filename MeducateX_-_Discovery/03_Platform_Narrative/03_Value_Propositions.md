# 03 Value Propositions

**Purpose:** Describe the measurable value while explicitly calling out non-goals.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-21

**Value propositions**
- Institutionalize surgical education with version-controlled content and governance-ready reporting.  
- Surface safety and quality signals that inform practice without directing care.  
- Provide audit trails and usage metrics that satisfy hospital compliance and credentialing reviews.

**Non-goals**
- MeducateX does not diagnose patients, suggest treatment decisions, or replace clinical judgement.  
- It is not a competitor to diagnostic AI or autonomous systems; it remains a supporting layer for human oversight.

This narrative stays within a decision-support framing and underscores that the platform extends, rather than replaces, existing governance processes.
